I recently graduated summa cum laude from Middlebury College with a B.A. in Geography and a minor in French. I have a breadth of experience using GIS and data analysis software to explore and understand environmental issues, with a particular focus on climate change awareness, adaptation, and resiliency. My work draws from a diverse set of backgrounds, including environmental and human geography, geology, ecology, and data science. I am seeking a dynamic position that allows me to combine my technical skills in GIS with my passion for the environment.
